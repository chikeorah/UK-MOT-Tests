# UK-MOT-Tests

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that attempts to clean up the 2023 MOT tests data in order to visualise it using Power BI. Given the size of the dataset, I encountered some difficulties in properly manipulating it solely within Power BI. To address this, I also utilised Python. Specifically, I leveraged Pandas, known for its robust data structures like Series and DataFrame, which efficiently handle large datasets. Pandas' DataFrame is also highly compatible with NumPy functions, accelerating my data manipulation process.

## Getting Started
